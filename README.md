# FirstGame

To play the game, download the repository and open the "Game Compiled"/"My labyrinth.exe".

The game is concise and only has 2 levels, to complete each level you have to kill all the enemies and collect all the coins.

If you wanna check out how it was done, I follow this [totorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPJCHvNZuB5ATsJZLKX3AW4V9XaIV9b).



**Thank you for playing my game.**
